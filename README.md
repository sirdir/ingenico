P.S. just reading throe doc find typo in code of example. At [Request example](https://epayments-api.developer-ingenico.com/s2sapi/v1/en_US/java/hostedcheckouts/create.html#hostedcheckouts-create-request-example) if you select in dropdown **Create hosted checkout basic EUR** in code of example you will still have `amountOfMoney.setCurrencyCode("USD");` instead of **EUR**
